
The project is aiming to find the relationship between features to better classify if the  borrower will default the loan using the borrowerâ€™s financial history. We use visualization  and model to achieve them. For the visualization, we could see most people have a loan term  of 3 or 5 years. A 3-year loan is less than that for a 5-year loan. Half of the defaulters have  one or even two houses. The vast majority of the data is 0. This indicates that their recent  credit is good, and the majority of them did not default on their loans intentionally.  Employees in the ordinary company often loan and have high default rates. Employees of  Fortune 500 companies and higher education rarely loan and have low default rates. Cities  with low-interest rates will have lower default rates. For the model part, we compare many  models that we find Random Forest model which has better performance than other models.  We put all the features into models to train that we get the feature importance. Stakeholders  could mention those features that are significantly related to classify if the borrower will  default the loan.
